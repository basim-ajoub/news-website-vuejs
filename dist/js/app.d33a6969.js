Last week, France suspended its joint military operations with Malian forces and stopped providing defence advice in the wake of the second coup in the country nine months. Paris cited the new military government’s failure to give guarantees to hold free elections for its decision.“We will make a drawdown in an organised way,” Macron told reporters, adding that details, including on the number of soldiers France is keeping in the region, will be finalised by the end of June.“We will have to hold a dialogue with our African and European partners.
