It comes on the same day the US Department of Labor issued an emergency rule for protecting workers in healthcare settings.The federal government employs more than four million people, making it the largest employer in the US. Nearly 60 percent of federal employees worked remotely during the pandemic, up from about 3 percent previously, according to Thursday’s memo.The guidance requires agencies to submit draft proposals by next week and more detailed final plans, including reopening schedules, by July 19.","category":"Economy"},{"pstno":"2","id":2,"title":"China passes law to counter foreign sanctions","date":"6/10/2020","imgsrc":"../economy2.jpg","discrption":"China has passed a law to counter foreign sanctions, as it strives to diffuse pressure from the United States and the European Union over trade, technology, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.China’s top legislature, the National People’s Congress standing committee (NPC) passed the law on Thursday, according to state television CCTV.

The country’s previous ruler, the late Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, managed to quell protesters by offering them generous state handouts.The new sultan responded to events in May in a similar fashion, promising nearly 15,000 public-sector jobs and another 15,000 jobs in the private sector to be funded by a $500 government stipend.But that strategy will likely delay reform designed to trim bloated state budgets and jump-start the country’s private sector to generate more jobs.“Some of the measures and reforms under the tawazun [or] ‘fiscal balancing’ plan will likely be scaled down, postponed, slowed, or sequenced in a more politically sensitive fashion,” Adel Hamaizia, a Gulf expert at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.","category":"Economy"},{"pstno":"4","id":4,"title":"Bitcoin Mining Council debuts as critics blast carbon footprint","date":"12/11/2020","imgsrc":"../economy4.jpg","discrption":"The Bitcoin Mining Council made its formal debut Thursday amid a growing debate over the amount of energy used in cryptocurrencies.“The Bitcoin Mining Council is a voluntary and open forum of Bitcoin miners committed to the network and its core principles,” MicroStrategy Inc. Chief Executive Officer Michael Saylor, who helped to form the association, wrote on Twitter. He added, “Join us,” alongside a praying-hands emoji.Saylor, who has made acquiring Bitcoin a business strategy of the enterprise software maker, sought to quell concern about the energy usage after Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk cited it as a reason to stop accepting Bitcoin as payment for the company’s cars. Musk later expressed support for the group.Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday blasted the energy use while chairing a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing that explored issues with existing cryptocurrencies as well as whether the U.S. Federal Reserve should issue its own. Later in a Bloomberg TV interview, she called cryptocurrencies “an environmental disaster.”The council is a voluntary forum that’s committed to the network and its core principles, reads its website. Nine companies, including MicroStrategy, Galaxy Digital and Darin Feinstein’s Blockcap, are listed as founding members.","category":"Economy"},{"pstno":"5","id":5,"title":"Lebanon electricity crisis: ‘Disaster in the making’","date":"6/13/2020","imgsrc":"../economy5.jpg","discrption":" Lebanon’s electricity sector is again on the verge of total failure, and the government has once more continued to throw money at it, instead of fixing it.State-run producer Électricité du Liban (EDL) ran out of funds to purchase fuel, so the government issued a letter to the central bank for an advance from its withering reserves.A source from the energy ministry told Al Jazeera the advance is worth $200m. The central bank’s subsidies, estimated at more than $15bn, are depleting rapidly, and Lebanon’s expensive and ineffective electricity sector is partly to blame.In a May 2020 presentation to international donors, Energy Minister Raymond Ghajar said that losses from the electricity sector cost about $1.6bn in public funds every year, though some reports say it can bleed up to $2bn. That is about 3 percent of the country’s entire economy, and experts told Al Jazeera it makes up for almost half of the cash-strapped country’s public debt.“In the absence of any political solutions, we’re just kicking the can down the road,” Marc Ayoub, Energy Researcher at the American University of Beirut’s Issam Fares Institute, told Al Jazeera. “If we pay $200m, we carry on for two or three more months, then what?
