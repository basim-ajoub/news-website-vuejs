It has taken an increasingly assertive stance since Tsai was first elected in 2016, claiming that she wants independence for the island’s 23.6 million people, and tensions have risen as traditional allies, including the United States, rallied to support Taiwan.Japan has for decades taken a quieter approach.

No strings attached,” Biden said, speaking alongside Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla in the English seaside resort of Carbis Bay before a G7 summit.“Our vaccine donations don’t include pressure for favours, or potential concessions.

It only covers surgical procedures done in the conventional way, he said.However, the hospital has promised to cover parts of the costs of robotic surgery – which is used in keyhole or minimally invasive surgery – to those patients who require it.The surgical robot is used in surgical subspecialties, including colorectal, gynecologic, and urologic surgeries; areas with remote or recessed locations.“There is no added coverage or financial benefit given to the hospital by the insurers,” said Sheikh Majid. “The patients will also not bear the cost. AL Zahra Hospital will offer this novel surgical technology at the same cost as conventional procedures which are normally covered by insurance companies,” he explained.“The added cost as result of this novel technology will be bared by the healthcare facility,” he added.","category":"Health"},{"pstno":"5","id":5,"title":"Rapid spread of Delta variant throws Johnson’s hopes of ending lockdown into doubt ","date":"6/13/2020","imgsrc":"../../health5.jpg","discrption":"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s hopes of ending England’s coronavirus lockdown on June 21 hung in the balance on Friday as data showed a further rise in cases of the rapidly spreading Delta variant.Johnson is due to announce on Monday whether the planned lifting of restrictions, which would see an end to limits on social contact, can go ahead on time.Read the latest updates in our dedicated coronavirus section.But the rapid spread of the Delta variant, officially a “variant of concern,” has thrown those plans into jeopardy, prompting speculation that the June 21 date will be pushed back, or that some restrictions will remain.“We have to be really careful.
