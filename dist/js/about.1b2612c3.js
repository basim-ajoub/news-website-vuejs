top court greenlights Copa America despite COVID fears","date":"12/4/2020","alte":"Sport","imgsrc":"../../sport1.jpg","discrption":"Brazil’s Supreme Court has ruled that the country can host the Copa America despite the coronavirus pandemic, clearing the way for the troubled football tournament to go ahead in three days.In an extraordinary virtual session held on Thursday, a majority of the high court’s 11 justices decided against plaintiffs who argued the South American championships posed an unacceptable health risk.Various judges, however, ordered the government to take additional safety measures.“It falls to (state governors and mayors) to set the appropriate health protocols and ensure they are respected in order to avoid a ‘Copavirus’, with new infections and the emergence of new variants,” wrote Justice Carmen Lucia in her ruling.The three cases before the court were the latest – and perhaps the last – edge-of-the-seat moment for organisers, who appear determined to pull off this edition of the world’s oldest running international football tournament despite the obstacles.Already delayed by a year because of the pandemic, the Copa America nearly unravelled when original co-hosts Colombia and Argentina fell through at the last minute – the former because of violent anti-government protests, the latter because of a surge of COVID-19 cases.With the clock ticking down to this Sunday’s opening match, Brazil stepped in last week as emergency hosts for the 10-nation tournament.But the decision is hugely controversial: Brazil is also reeling from COVID-19, which has killed nearly 480,000 people in the country, second only to the United States.","category":"Sport"},{"pstno":"2","id":2,"title":"Naomi Osaka thanks fans after French Open

withdrew from the French Open earlier this week, citing mental health issues.The world number two initially said she would not attend the tournament’s mandatory post-match press conferences, which she said put undue pressure on players.French tennis officials fined Osaka $15,000 and threatened to expel her from the tournament for not honouring mandatory media commitments.After her first-round win, the 23-year-old announced she was withdrawing from the tournament and revealed she had been suffering bouts of depression for several years, leading to an outpouring of support.“Just want to thank you for all the love,” she wrote in an Instagram story. “Haven’t been on my phone much but I wanted to hop on here and tell you all that I really appreciate it.”","category":"Sport"},{"pstno":"3","id":3,"title":"Carlo Ancelotti appointed new Real Madrid coach","date":"9/20/2020","alte":"basim","imgsrc":"../../sport3.jpg","discrption":"Carlo Ancelotti has returned to Real Madrid for a second spell as coach, rejoining the Spanish giants from the English side Everton.The Italian, who was previously in charge of the Madrid-based club between 2013 and 2015, has agreed to a three-year deal at the Bernabeu. He replaces Zinedine Zidane, who left Real last week after the team’s first trophyless season in more than 10 years.“Carlo Ancelotti will be the new first team coach for the next three seasons,” a brief Real Madrid statement read.He will sign his contract and be presented to the media on Wednesday.Ancelotti had been in charge at Goodison Park since December 2019, leading Everton to a 10th place finish in the Premier League last season.The 61-year-old, who has one of the most decorated CVs in world football, won the Champions League with Real in 2014, helping the Spaniards to their fabled “Decima” (10th) European crown, before being sacked 12 months later.He is one of the three coaches – along with former Liverpool manager Bob Paisley and Zidane – to have won the European Cup or Champions League on three occasions, having also led AC Milan to glory in 2003 and 2007.","category":"Sport"},{"pstno":"4","id":4,"title":"Champions League final ‘didn’t go perfectly’, Portugal PM admits","date":"1/2/2021","alte":"basim","imgsrc":"../../sport4.jpg","discrption":"Portugal’s prime minister has said his government must do better after coming under fire over its failure to enforce measures aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus during the Champions League final.Thousands of English supporters flocked to the coastal city of Porto in the days leading to Saturday’s match between Manchester City and Chelsea.Images posted on social media showed large crowds of people gathered outside restaurants and cafes without masks or social distancing.“Every day, unfortunately, there are people who do not respect the rules, but that doesn’t mean the rules are illegitimate,” Prime Minister Antonio Costa told reporters on Monday, admitting the event “didn’t go perfectly”.“It is clear that what happened this weekend cannot serve as an example, it must serve as a lesson,” Costa said, adding authorities must work to provide more information to tourists about measures they must adopt during their holidays.Separately Portugal’s Health Minister Marta Temido said: “I am sure that right now all Portuguese know that there is a set of rules that we have to continue to follow and others not complying with those rules should not be an alibi.”Earlier, the government came under fire from some legislators for sending contradictory COVID-19 messages ahead of the match, in which Chelsea beat Manchester City 1-0.“The government and Porto’s mayor should apologise to the Portuguese, who, deprived of so much, are watching this disgrace in the midst of fighting the pandemic,” opposition leader Rui Rio wrote on Twitter.However, precautions were taken which meant all fans had to present a negative COVID-19 test on arrival in Portugal, which is on the British government’s “green” list allowing tourists to visit without quarantining on their return.","category":"Sport"},{"pstno":"5","id":5,"title":"Zidane left Real Madrid because club had ‘no faith’ in

second spell in March 2019 after having won two La Liga titles and three consecutive Champions League titles in his first stint from 2016 to 2018.However, he stepped down last week after Real suffered their first trophy-less season in 11 years, finishing second in La Liga, being knocked out of the Champions League semi-finals and suffering a humiliating Copa del Rey exit in the round-of-32 to third division minnows Alcoyano.In an open letter published in sports daily AS on Monday, Zidane said the first time he left as coach in 2018 was because he felt the team needed a new approach to stay at the highest level after enjoying so much success.“Right now, things are different … I’m leaving because I feel the club no longer has the faith in me I need, nor the support to build something in the medium or long term,” Zidane wrote, with the 48-year-old adding he deserved more recognition from the club for his work.","category":"Sport"}]')},c053:function(e,t,a){},ce0d:function(e,t,a){},d47f:function(e,t,a){},e76e:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("91aa")},f820:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var
